# Sliding windows

This topic describes how to use sliding window functions in Realtime Compute for Apache Flink.

**Note:** In Realtime Compute for Apache Flink, sliding windows cannot be used in conjunction with LAST\_VALUE, FIRST\_VALUE, or TopN functions.

## Introduction

A sliding window is also known as a hop window. Unlike tumbling windows, sliding windows can overlap with each other.

A sliding window is defined by the following parameters: slide and size. The slide parameter specifies the length of a sliding step. The size parameter specifies the size of the window.

-   If the value of slide is smaller than that of size, the windows overlap with each other and each element is assigned to multiple windows.
-   If the value of slide is equal to that of size, the windows are tumbling windows.
-   If the value of slide is greater than that of size, the windows do not overlap with each other but are separated with gaps.

In most cases, most elements are assigned to multiple windows and the windows overlap with each other. Sliding windows are used to calculate moving averages. For example, to calculate the data average in the last 5 minutes every 10 seconds, set slide to 10 seconds and set size to 5 minutes. The following figure shows sliding windows for which the slide value is 30 seconds and the size value is 1 minute.

## Syntax of sliding window functions

You can use the HOP function to define a sliding window in a GROUP BY clause.

```
HOP(<time-attr>, <slide-interval>,<size-interval>)
<slide-interval>: INTERVAL 'string' timeUnit
<size-interval>: INTERVAL 'string' timeUnit            
```

**Note:**

The `<time-attr>` parameter must be a valid time attribute field in a stream. This parameter specifies whether the time attribute is processing time or event time. For more information about [Time attributes](/intl.en-US/Exclusive Mode/Flink SQL/Basic concepts/Time attributes.md) and [Watermark](/intl.en-US/Exclusive Mode/Flink SQL/Basic concepts/Watermark.md), see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Exclusive Mode/Flink SQL/Window functions/Overview.md).

## Window identifier functions

A window identifier function specifies the start time, end time, or time attribute of a specified window. The time attribute is used to aggregate lower-level windows.

|Function|Return type|Description|
|--------|-----------|-----------|
|`HOP_START (<time-attr>, <slide-interval>, <size-interval>)`|TIMESTAMP|Returns the start time of the window. The boundary for the start time is included in the time span of the window. For example, if the time span of a window is `[00:10, 00:15)`, `00:10` is returned.|
|`HOP_END (<time-attr>, <slide-interval>, <size-interval>)`|TIMESTAMP|Returns the end time of the window. The boundary for the end time is included in the time span of the window. For example, if the time span of a window is `[00:00, 00:15)`, `00:15` is returned.|
|`HOP_ROWTIME (<time-attr>, <slide-interval>, <size-interval>)`|TIMESTAMP \(rowtime-attr\)|Returns the end time of the window. The boundary for the end time is excluded from the time span of the window. For example, if the time span of a window is `[00:00, 00:15)`, `00:14:59.999` is returned. The returned value is a rowtime attribute value based on which time operations can be performed. This function can be used in only the windows that are based on the event time, such as cascading windows. For more information, see [Cascading windows](/intl.en-US/Exclusive Mode/Flink SQL/Window functions/Overview.mdsection_cwf_1kt_jhb).|
|`HOP_PROCTIME (<time-attr>, <slide-interval>, <size-interval>)`|TIMESTAMP \(rowtime-attr\)|Returns the end time of the window. The boundary for the end time is excluded from the time span of the window. For example, if the time span of a window is `[00:00, 00:15)`, `00:14:59.999` is returned. The returned value is a proctime attribute value based on which time operations can be performed. This function can be used in only the windows that are based on the processing time, such as cascading windows. For more information, see [Cascading windows](/intl.en-US/Exclusive Mode/Flink SQL/Window functions/Overview.mdsection_cwf_1kt_jhb).|

## Examples

In the following example, a 1-minute window slides once every 30 seconds. You can use the windows to count the number of clicks per user over the last minute every 30 seconds.

    If a sliding window cannot read the time at which data enters the window, the start time of the first window is moved forward. You can use the following formula to calculate the time interval by which the start time is moved forward: Time interval = Window duration - Sliding step.

    |Window duration \(seconds\)|Sliding step \(seconds\)|Event Time|Start time of the first window|End time of the first window|
    |---------------------------|------------------------|----------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
    |120|30|`2019-07-31 10:00:00.0`|`2019-07-31 09:58:30.0`|`2019-07-31 10:00:30.0`|
    |60|10|`2019-07-31 10:00:00.0`|`2019-07-31 09:59:10.0`|`2019-07-31 10:00:10.0`|
